This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

## GraphQL Operations

### Generic Filter Library

The Generic Filter Library provides pre-built firewall filters (70+ service-specific filters) that can be assigned to VMs and departments.

**GraphQL Files:**
- Query definitions: [src/gql/queries/genericFilters.graphql](src/gql/queries/genericFilters.graphql)
- Mutation definitions: [src/gql/mutations/genericFilters.graphql](src/gql/mutations/genericFilters.graphql)
- Generated hooks: `src/gql/hooks.ts` (auto-generated by codegen)

**Available Queries:**
- `useGetGenericFiltersQuery()` - Fetches all generic filters (70+ predefined service filters)
- `useGetVMAssignedGenericFiltersQuery({ variables: { vmId } })` - Fetches assigned filters for a VM with inheritance information
- `useGetDepartmentAssignedGenericFiltersQuery({ variables: { departmentId } })` - Fetches assigned filters for a department

**Available Mutations:**
- `useAssignGenericFilterToVMMutation()` - Assigns a generic filter to a VM
- `useUnassignGenericFilterFromVMMutation()` - Removes a generic filter from a VM (admin-only for critical filters)
- `useAssignGenericFilterToDepartmentMutation()` - Assigns a generic filter to a department
- `useUnassignGenericFilterFromDepartmentMutation()` - Removes a generic filter from a department (admin-only for critical filters)

**Running Codegen:**

After modifying any `.graphql` files, run the following command from the `frontend/` directory to regenerate TypeScript types and hooks:

```bash
npm run codegen
```

The codegen reads from `src/gql/queries/**/*.graphql` and `src/gql/mutations/**/*.graphql` and generates hooks in `src/gql/hooks.ts`.

**WebSocket Events:**

The mutations emit real-time events that can be subscribed to:
- `firewall:generic:assigned` - When a filter is assigned to a VM
- `firewall:generic:unassigned` - When a filter is removed from a VM
- `firewall:generic:assigned:department` - When a filter is assigned to a department
- `firewall:generic:unassigned:department` - When a filter is removed from a department
